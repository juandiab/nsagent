# JPilot

**JPilot** — an AI-assisted management platform for network appliances. Register NetScaler ADC (MPX/VPX), SDX, Cisco IOS/XE switches, and F5 BIG-IP; connect **your own** AI provider keys; and use JPilot chat with vendor-specific tools, prompts, and memory.

The **Free edition** is offered at no charge so teams can try the product and so practitioners can see how it works. **Nexxus-Tech SAS does not supply or pay for AI inference** — you choose the provider, you hold the API keys, and **you pay that provider** under its terms. JPilot only connects to what you configure.

**Current release:** `v0.31` — Nexxus license activation, online sync, and offline `.lic` import in Settings.

Bump the root [`VERSION`](VERSION) file when tagging a release so in-app update checks match GitHub.

## Features

- **Appliance inventory** — vendor → device → credentials wizard; **tags** for filtering; MPX, VPX, SDX, Cisco, and F5 product lines; **Beta Available** badges on SDX, Cisco, and F5; encrypted credentials (Fernet).
- **AI provider management** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, LM Studio, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints; assign each model to **Architect**, **Operator**, and/or **Analyst** roles.
- **JPilot chat** — tool-calling agent bound to the selected appliance; credentials never sent to the LLM.
- **JPilot roles** — **Architect** (structured discovery and formal design documents), **Operator** (configure the ADC, including from attached `.md` designs), **Analyst** (read-first troubleshooting); dual-pane defaults to Architect + Operator; per-pane **context usage** ring and **Stop** while generating.
- **Architect design workflow** — choice/boolean `jpilot-form` discovery; deliverable outline with AWS/Azure, Gateway integrations, and AAA topics; downloadable design `.md`; official doc reference index (Citrix Gateway, authentication, Tech Zone).
- **JPilot command menu** — searchable recommended actions by role with section grouping (~200 prompts); filters to the **selected appliance vendor** (NetScaler, SDX, Cisco, F5).
- **MCP server** — Model Context Protocol tools for Next-Gen API, classic CLI over SSH, NITRO helpers, diagnostics, and SSL key/CSR generation.
- **Multi-vendor brain** — `resources/vendors/<id>/manifest.json` drives memory, prompts, tools, and connect mode; NetScaler, Cisco, SDX, and F5 BIG-IP supported today.
- **Token-optimized chat** — intent-based tool routing, slimmer Architect prompts (on-demand resource search), 18-message history, 10k-char tool results.
- **Memory-guided RAG** — `backend-api/app/resources/memory/<vendor>/` gates API/CLI usage before execution.
- **Classic + Next-Gen** — list virtual servers from Next-Gen applications and classic `lbvserver`; create apps via Next-Gen or multi-step LB setup via CLI.
- **Guided load balancer forms** — JPilot can embed interactive `jpilot-form` blocks in chat (VIP, service type, backends, monitors); submissions drive CLI execution after reference lookup.
- **Smart form routing** — responder, rewrite, transform, and other policy-on-vserver requests do not trigger the LB creation form.
- **Authentication** — password login until a passkey is registered; then passkey-only sign-in (password login blocked server-side).
- **Account recovery** — email OTP via SMTP; self-service at `/account-recovery` or admin-initiated from Users; revokes passkeys and resets password and/or registers a new passkey.
- **User management** — admin CRUD for users (roles `admin` / `user`), email for resets, initial password on create, passkey count and removal.
- **SSL certificate tools** — generate CSRs or self-signed certificates on the appliance (UI + API + MCP).
- **NetScaler diagnostics** — ICMP ping/traceroute, TCP port reachability via telnet from the appliance shell, and read-only `nsconmsg` performance/event collection.
- **Optional Brave Search** — vendor-isolated official-doc web search (Citrix/NetScaler, Cisco, or F5 domains only; Settings → AI Providers).
- **Settings → Beta features** — enable MCP tools per beta platform (SDX, Cisco IOS/XE, F5 BIG-IP) next to Next-Gen API; shared SSH settings on the Next-Gen tab.
- **Dashboard shortcuts** — recommended JPilot prompts and links (health summary, list IPs/vservers, diagnostics, guided LB).
- **Model usage dashboard** — Settings → AI Providers shows monthly LLM token/request usage and Brave Search query usage with progress bars (tracked locally per calendar month).
- **Cisco IOS/XE (SSH)** — Architect, Operator, and Analyst over SSH with `search_cisco_cli_reference` memory gate (beta).
- **NetScaler SDX (SSH)** — Operator and Analyst for SVM platform and VPX lifecycle with `search_sdx_cli_reference` memory gate (beta).
- **F5 BIG-IP (SSH / TMSH)** — Operator, Analyst, and Architect (official F5 docs only); `f5_*` MCP tools and `search_f5_tmsh_reference` / `search_f5_documentation` (beta).
- **Nexxus licensing** — Settings → **License**: enter a license code, import an offline `.lic` file, or sync with the Nexxus licensing API; installation fingerprint binding; encrypted payload validation; daily background sync and expiry enforcement.

## What's new in v0.31

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **License (Settings)** | New **License** panel: save a `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` code, **Import offline license** (`.lic`), view status, type, expiry, and holder details. |
| **Online sync** | On startup and daily, JPilot POSTs to Nexxus `/licensing/sync` with `appFingerprint`, `appName`, and license code; persists `expirationDate`, `registrationDate`, `validityDays`, `licenseType`, `renewalCount`, and `encryptedLicense` in MongoDB. |
| **Encrypted payload** | Decrypts `encryptedLicense` with HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM; prefers signed bundle fields when they differ from top-level sync JSON. |
| **Sync outcomes** | Handles active/renewed (200), expired/deactivated (403), missing license (404), and code mismatch; local expiry check after each successful sync. |
| **Configuration** | Optional `NEXXUS_LICENSING_BASE_URL` and `LICENSE_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` in `.env` (see `.env.example`). |
| **Bootstrap admin** | Docs clarify installer-written `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (seed once; leave blank afterward). |

## What's new in v0.30

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Recommended actions** | Command menu shows only prompts for the **selected appliance vendor**; **15** starter actions each for SDX, Cisco IOS/XE, and F5 BIG-IP (plus Cisco Architect design prompts). |
| **Background chat** | JPilot keeps generating when you leave the pane or navigate away; **toast + sound** when the reply finishes (Settings → JPilot → Reply notifications); sidebar dot while a pane is busy. |
| **Architect discovery** | F5 and Cisco Architect roles use **`jpilot-form`** discovery (no checklist loops); server nudge when the model skips forms; **go** produces the design document from chat history. |
| **Cisco Architect** | New `architect.md` / `architect_discovery.md` prompts (fixes missing role prompt error). |
| **CLI memory fix** | Restored `MEMORY_CANDIDATE_PATHS` for the NetScaler CLI command index (fixes Operator form execution after CS/LB submissions). |

## What's new in v0.29

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|

## What's new in v0.28

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **AI provider roles** | Settings → AI Providers: assign each LLM to Architect, Operator, and/or Analyst (icon + checkbox per role). Chat shows provider **names** only and auto-picks the role-matched model. |
| **Context usage ring** | Each chat pane shows an estimated **context %** (Cursor-style) with green / amber / red thresholds and a hover breakdown. |
| **Stop generation** | **Stop** in the toolbar, thinking bubble, and input bar cancels in-flight chat; backend stops between tool/LLM iterations when the client disconnects. |
| **Role-aware appliances** | **Architect** — all inventory appliances (optional reference, no connect required); **Operator** / **Analyst** — **NetScaler only**; beta vendors show a **Beta** tag. Inventory and chat lists show **name (vendor)**. |
| **Cisco chat fixes** | Correct vendor context when switching appliances; Cisco static-route memory; operator prompt forbids NetScaler syntax on IOS/XE devices. |
| **Stability** | Fix missing `copilot_vendor_is_supported` import that blocked Operator/Analyst chat; copilot appliance list returns full inventory. |

## What's new in v0.27

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **F5 BIG-IP** | Vendor `f5`: TMSH over SSH (`f5_*` MCP tools), memory, Operator/Analyst/Architect prompts, manifest, and memory gate for destructive TMSH ops. |
| **Beta features settings** | Settings → **Beta features** tab (after Next-Gen API): per-platform tool toggles, doc links, enable/disable all for SDX, Cisco, and F5. |
| **Vendor-isolated web search** | Brave results scoped per vendor (`vendor_doc_domains.py`); Cisco and F5 CLI/doc search use only official vendor domains; Citrix/NetScaler extras unchanged. |
| **UI** | **Beta Available** tags on SDX, Cisco IOS/XE, and F5 in Add appliance and Vendor support; Brave Search panel shows locked domains per vendor. |

## What's new in v0.26

| Area | Highlights |

|------|------------|
| **NetScaler SDX** | Vendor `sdx`: MCP `sdx_*` tools, SVM memory file, Operator/Analyst prompts, manifest, and memory gate for destructive VPX ops. |
| **Add appliance UX** | Stepped flow: vendor → device (Available / Coming soon) → details; Citrix MPX and VPX as separate products; single **Add appliance** button. |
| **Inventory tags** | Optional `tags[]` on appliances; tag chips in the table; click-to-filter bar above inventory. |
| **Product line** | Optional `productId` on appliances (e.g. `netscaler-mpx` vs `netscaler-vpx`) for accurate Platform labels. |
| **Vendor support** | Roadmap panel in its own section below the inventory table (not nested in the DataTable panel). |

## What's new in v0.24

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Vendor manifests** | `resources/vendors/{netscaler,cisco}/manifest.json` — single source of truth for tools, memory, prompts, connect mode, and roles (`vendor_registry.py`). |
| **Brain layout** | `memory/<vendor>/`, `prompts/<vendor>/roles/`, `architect/<vendor>/`; prod bind-mounts all of `resources/`. |
| **Prompts as files** | Live system prompts loaded from markdown with `{{include:…}}` fragments; `search_jpilot_architect_resources` for Architect outline on demand. |
| **Token optimization** | `copilot_tool_router.py` sends a subset of tools per intent; Architect prompt slimmed (~3k vs ~15k+ chars). |
| **Cisco switches** | MCP tools `cisco_*`, memory `cisco_ios_switch_memory.md`, Operator/Analyst prompts, SSH connect test, inventory `copilotEligible`. |
| **Tests** | Vendor registry, prompt loader, and tool router unit tests. |

## What's new in v0.23

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Architect** | One-topic discovery via `jpilot-form` (`choice` and boolean fields); design document outline (AWS, Azure autoscale, Gateway + Citrix integrations, Gateway AAA); `<!-- jpilot-design-document -->` marker and **Download design document** in chat. |
| **Operator** | Implement attached `.md` designs on the connected appliance using forms instead of prose questionnaires (`Configuration inputs for:`). |
| **Analyst** | Renamed from Investigator (`analyst` role id; legacy alias preserved). |
| **Command menu** | `AskJpilotCommandMenu` with tabs, filters, and section headers; expanded recommended actions for Architect, Operator, and Analyst. |
| **Chat errors** | Clear messages for 504/timeouts, quota exhaustion, and context limits; backend `httpx` timeouts return structured 504 detail. |
| **Nginx** | `/api/` proxy read/send timeouts increased to 300s for long JPilot turns. |
| **Settings** | Attach `.md` / `.markdown` design files in JPilot settings. |
| **Docs domains** | `community.citrix.com` (Tech Zone) allowed for web search and citations. |

## What's new in v0.22

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Passkey login** | Cross-device sign-in for passkey-only accounts: hybrid transport hints on the server, a **Sign in from your phone** panel under the passkey button, and auto-start of the QR flow once terms are accepted. |
| **WebAuthn API** | `POST /auth/webauthn/login/begin` accepts optional `preferCrossDevice` to prioritize the browser’s QR / phone passkey dialog. |

## What's new in v0.21

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Settings → MCP Server** | MCP status (URL, tools, message) lives inside the MCP Server panel instead of a separate row below MCP/SMTP. |

## What's new in v0.20

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **About / updates** | When an update is available, GitHub release notes render in a side panel next to the upgrade instructions (fetched from the latest release). |

## What's new in v0.19

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **About / updates** | Upgrade steps and `./scripts/upgrade.sh` / `upgrade.ps1` commands show only when a newer release is available. |
| **Settings** | Security, Legal, and About use full-width layout like other sections. |

## What's new in v0.18

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Settings layout** | AI Providers: documentation web search and model usage side by side. MCP Server and SMTP / Email side by side with a two-column SMTP form. Directional slide when changing tabs (left/right follows nav order). |
| **Page chrome** | Removed redundant page titles on Settings, JPilot, and Appliances. |
| **Dashboard** | Platform status tags in one row. |
| **Shell** | Main content height matches the sidebar; legal footer aligns with the bottom of the menu. |

## What's new in v0.17

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **upgrade script** | After `git pull origin main`, pick **one** stack to rebuild: `1` development, `2` production, or `q` to skip. No more separate yes/no prompts for both stacks. |

## What's new in v0.16

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Deploy scripts** | `./scripts/prod-up.sh` — production `build` + `up -d` from repo root. `./scripts/upgrade.sh` — `git pull origin main`, then choose dev **or** prod to rebuild. PowerShell equivalents included. |

## What's new in v0.15

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Docker Compose** | Dev: `docker compose up -d --build` (no profiles). Prod: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`. Production overlay removes the Vite `frontend` service via compose merge. |
| **Dashboard** | Smaller welcome panel; removed page title/subtitle; appliances + AI providers stacked left, quick actions + platform status right; blog carousel pinned above the legal footer (duplicate marketing footer removed). |
| **Plans** | Removed page title/subtitle; plan cards first; compact platform highlights in a 2×3 grid (left two-thirds) beside **Need Enterprise?** (right one-third). |

## What's new in v0.14

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **JPilot layout** | Copilot page height accounts for shell padding and main-content bottom spacing (`calc(100vh - 5rem)`); `overflow: hidden` prevents page scroll. |
| **Dashboard & Plans** | `@media (max-height: 900px)` compacts welcome/hero spacing, grids, marketing blog cards, and plan cards so Dashboard and Plans fit 1080p and iPad Pro 13″ landscape without scrolling past the footer. |

## What's new in v0.13

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Production compose** | `docker-compose.prod.yml` is an **overlay** on `docker-compose.yml` (use both `-f` flags or `./compose.sh` with `NSAGENT_DEPLOY_MODE=prod`). Clears dev bind mounts, removes the Vite frontend service, and serves the built UI from nginx. |
| **Startup order** | MCP and backend healthchecks; API waits for healthy MongoDB **and** MCP before starting; nginx waits for a healthy backend. |
| **MCP URL migration** | Stored MCP settings that point at `localhost` are rewritten to `http://mcp-server:8001` on startup (fixes MCP calls from inside Docker). |
| **MongoDB connect** | Backend verifies MongoDB with an admin `ping` and a 5s server-selection timeout during startup. |

## What's new in v0.12

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **JPilot roles** | **Architect** (plan without a connected appliance), **Operator** (configure the ADC), **Analyst** (read-first troubleshooting). Icon `SelectButton` per chat pane; dual-pane layout defaults to Architect + Operator. `GET /api/copilot/roles`. |
| **Architect fixes** | No false “no changes applied” banner or auto LB creation form when planning changes on an existing vserver (e.g. secure headers on `lb_01`). |
| **Settings** | Fixed `KeepAlive` template structure so Settings tabs cache correctly without a Vue compile error. |
| **MongoDB (prod)** | Pin `mongo:8.2`, `restart: unless-stopped`, healthcheck; `backend-api` / `mcp-server` wait for healthy MongoDB. |
| **nginx** | Separate **login** zone (`10r/m`) for `POST /api/auth/login`; **contact** zone (`5r/m`) for recovery and other `/api/auth` paths. |

## What's new in v0.11

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Auth** | nginx `/api/auth` rate limit raised from 5 to **15 requests/minute** (burst 15) for login, passkey, and recovery flows. |

## What's new in v0.10

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Fix** | Settings sections cached with `KeepAlive` so switching tabs no longer remounts panels and refetches `/api/ai-providers`, platform settings, and usage dashboard on every visit. |
| **Fix** | Production nginx API rate limit aligned with dev (`30r/s`, burst 60) — fixes 503 errors when jumping between Settings tabs (was `20r/m` in prod templates). |
| **UI** | Login page visual refresh (animated background, scroll-in animations). |
| **UI** | Global page fade transitions on route changes. |

## What's new in v0.09

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Settings UX** | Tabs grouped as Platform, People, Personal, and App; setup-first order (AI Providers → JPilot → MCP → Next-Gen → Users → Security → About → Legal). |
| **Naming** | Settings tab renamed from Chat to JPilot. |

## What's new in v0.08

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Fix** | Dev stack mounts `VERSION` at `/usr/share/jpilot/VERSION` so it no longer conflicts with the `./backend-api:/app` bind mount. |

## What's new in v0.07

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Updates** | Settings → About checks GitHub for new versions; banner when an update is available; copy-paste rebuild instructions for macOS/Linux and Windows. |
| **Versioning** | Root `VERSION` file baked into the backend; compares against GitHub tags (falls back when no GitHub Release is published). |
| **Deploy modes** | Installer lets you pick production (compiled) or development (hot reload); `compose.sh` / `compose.ps1` pick the right stack from `.env`. |
| **Production stack** | `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.prod.yml` overlay — compiled frontend in nginx, no dev bind mounts on API services. |

## What's new in v0.06

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Settings hub** | Single Settings page with tabs: MCP Server, Chat, AI Providers, Next-Gen API, Security, Legal. |
| **AI Providers** | LLM provider CRUD and Brave Search (visually separate from LLMs) moved from the main menu; usage dashboard lives in the same tab. |
| **Next-Gen API** | Connection and reference panel moved to Settings → Next-Gen API (`/next-gen-api` redirects). |
| **NetScalers** | SSL Certificate Tools moved to NetScalers → SSL Certificates tab (`/ssl-csr` redirects). |
| **Navigation** | Slimmer sidebar: Dashboard, JPilot, NetScalers, Settings (+ Users for admins). |
| **MCP catalog** | Settings tool list synced with server — Next-Gen request, diagnostics, telnet, nsconmsg, CSR generation. |
| **Performance** | nginx API rate limit raised (`30r/s`, burst 60) to prevent 503s when Settings loads multiple endpoints. |
| **Fixes** | Settings lazy-loads section data on tab switch; route redirects for moved pages. |

## What's new in v0.05

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **JPilot forms** | `ChatConfigForm` in chat; backend parses `jpilot-form` JSON; default classic LB form when creating vservers; workload-aware defaults (StoreFront, Delivery Controllers). |
| **Form heuristics** | LB form only for real provisioning requests — not responder/rewrite/redirect/bind-to-existing-vserver work. |
| **Memory gates** | `search_netscaler_nextgen_api` required before Next-Gen inventory tools; `search_netscaler_cli_reference` before SSH/CLI writes; destructive ops need `confirmed=true`. |
| **Orchestrator** | Stronger tool-execution nudges, retry hints, discovery vs config-change detection, improved tool traces in the UI. |
| **CLI reference** | Command index, expanded catalog, richer memory search and recommended commands for JPilot. |
| **System info** | Firmware/version via NITRO `nsversion` when Next-Gen summary is incomplete. |
| **SSL tools** | `POST /ssl/generate-csr`, MCP CSR/self-signed generation on appliance via OpenSSL shell. |
| **Auth** | User email field, admin-triggered reset codes, public reset-password page. |
| **AI providers** | Grok (xAI), DeepSeek, LM Studio, OpenAI-Compatible with in-app setup hints. |
| **UI** | Dashboard actions, SSL CSR page, pricing/plans view, login/reset flows, session and chat polish. |

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- NetScaler ADC with **Next-Gen API** enabled (`enable ns nextgenapi`) for API tools
- SSH access to the appliance for classic CLI and diagnostic tools (port 22)
- SMTP server (optional, for password reset emails)

## Quick start

The only prerequisite is **Docker**. The installer downloads the project, generates the
secrets and TLS certificate, writes `.env`, launches the stack, and opens JPilot in your
browser. Pick your platform:

### Windows

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) (and
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)). Then, in **PowerShell**:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juandiab/nsagent/main/get.ps1 | iex
```

### macOS

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) (or let the
installer set it up via Homebrew). Then, in **Terminal**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juandiab/nsagent/main/get.sh | bash
```

### Ubuntu / Linux

Docker Engine is required — if it's missing, the installer offers to install it for you.
Then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juandiab/nsagent/main/get.sh | bash
```

---

The script checks for Docker (offering to install it if absent), downloads JPilot, and
starts the setup wizard. Then:

1. Open **https://localhost:9443** (the installer uses a self-signed certificate, so
   accept the one-time browser warning).
2. Complete the wizard: admin account, domain, **deploy mode** (production or development),
   and TLS (self-signed or your own cert).
3. On the **Review** step, **save the generated `NSAGENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** — it is
   required to restore or migrate the install and cannot be recovered.
4. Click **Install JPilot**. The wizard writes `.env` and `nginx/ssl/`, and your
   terminal automatically launches the full stack and opens it in your browser.
5. Sign in at **https://&lt;your-domain&gt;** with the admin account you created.

> Already cloned the repo? Skip the one-liner and just run `./install.sh` (macOS/Linux) or
> `.\install.ps1` (Windows) from the project root.

To reconfigure an existing install (overwrites `.env`):

```bash
./install.sh --reconfigure      # macOS / Linux
.\install.ps1 -Reconfigure      # Windows (PowerShell)
```

> The installer generates `NSAGENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (Fernet) and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
> automatically and derives the WebAuthn, CORS, and API-URL settings from the domain
> you choose. See [Manual setup](#manual-setup-advanced) below if you prefer to
> configure `.env` by hand.

After first login:

   - **NetScalers** — add your appliance (name, host, API/SSH user and password); **SSL Certificates** tab for CSR/self-signed generation.
   - **Settings → AI Providers** — add an LLM provider, set default, configure optional Brave Search, and view usage.
   - **Settings → MCP Server** — tool toggles, **SSH fallback** (required for diagnostics and SSL shell), SMTP, timeouts.
   - **Settings → Next-Gen API** — test Next-Gen connection and browse API reference.
   - **Settings → Security** — register an optional passkey after password login.
   - **Users** (admin) — create users with email (for password reset) and initial passwords.
   - **JPilot** — select an appliance and ask questions or request changes.

### Manual setup (advanced)

Prefer to configure things by hand instead of the wizard? You can:

1. **Generate an encryption key**

   ```bash
   python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```

2. **Configure environment** — `cp .env.example .env` and edit:

   | Variable                 | Description                          |
   |--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
   | `NSAGENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Fernet key for appliance credentials |
   | `JWT_SECRET_KEY`         | Secret for session JWTs              |
   | `ADMIN_USERNAME`         | Bootstrap admin (installer sets; leave blank after) |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD`         | Bootstrap password (installer sets; leave blank after) |
   | `NSAGENT_DEPLOY_MODE`    | `prod` (compiled, default) or `dev` (hot reload) |
   | `NGINX_HOSTNAME`         | Public hostname for nginx TLS        |
   | `NEXXUS_LICENSING_BASE_URL` | Nexxus licensing API base (optional; default in config) |
   | `LICENSE_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Background license sync interval (default `86400`) |
   | `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`         | WebAuthn RP ID (usually your hostname or `localhost`) |
   | `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`        | Exact UI origin (e.g. `https://your-domain`) |
   | `CORS_ORIGINS`           | Comma-separated allowed browser origins |
   | `SMTP_*`                 | Optional — required for email password reset |
   | `PASSWORD_RESET_LOG_CODES` | Dev only: log reset codes to backend logs |

3. **Provide TLS certificates** — place `cert.crt` and `cert.key` in `nginx/ssl/`
   (see [nginx/ssl/README.md](nginx/ssl/README.md)). nginx will not start without them.

4. **Start the stack** — `./compose.sh up --build` (reads `NSAGENT_DEPLOY_MODE` from `.env`), then open `https://<NGINX_HOSTNAME>`.

## Authentication

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Password login** | `POST /auth/login` — allowed only while the user has **no** registered passkeys. |
| **Passkey login** | Required once a passkey exists; `POST /auth/webauthn/login/begin\|finish`. |
| **Passkey registration** | Authenticated users register in **Settings → Security** (email required on the account). |
| **Account recovery** | `POST /auth/account-recovery/request` (self-service) or admin from **Users**; user completes at `/account-recovery` via `POST /auth/password-reset/confirm` (removes passkeys; optional new password; optional short-lived token to register a new passkey). |
| **Bootstrap admin** | Installer writes `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to `.env` once; API seeds MongoDB on first startup. Leave blank in `.env` afterward — login uses the DB. |

WebAuthn and CORS origins must match how users open the UI (see `.env.example`).

## JPilot behavior

The orchestrator enforces:

1. **`search_netscaler_nextgen_api`** before Next-Gen API tools (returns blocked JSON if skipped).
2. **`search_netscaler_cli_reference`** before SSH/CLI write tools.
3. **Tool execution** for config changes — the model must call `netscaler_run_cli_command` or `netscaler_run_cli_commands`, not only list commands.
4. **Confirmation** for destructive CLI/API operations (`rm`, `DELETE`, `unbind`, etc.) via `confirmed=true` after user approval.
5. **Diagnostics run immediately** — no memory search required for ping, traceroute, TCP port checks, or nsconmsg.
6. **Guided LB forms** — for new classic LB vserver requests, JPilot may show an in-chat form; policy work (responder, rewrite, bind-to-existing vserver) does not use that form.

### Connectivity and diagnostics routing

| User question | Tool | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------|
| Can the appliance ping / reach host (no port)? | `netscaler_run_diagnostic` | `operation`: `ping`, `ping6`, `traceroute`, `traceroute6` |
| Is port N open on host? / reach `IP:PORT`? | `netscaler_telnet` or `netscaler_run_diagnostic` | `operation`: `tcp_port`, plus `port` |
| Performance stats, counters, event logs | `netscaler_collect_nsconmsg` | Read-only `/netscaler/nsconmsg` over SSH |

**Auto TCP port check:** when a JPilot message includes a host and port (e.g. `192.168.20.36:1234`), the backend runs `netscaler_telnet` automatically and returns the verdict — no need for the LLM to choose the tool.

**NetScaler ADC note:** TCP port checks use `/usr/bin/telnet` via `shell sh -c 'telnet HOST PORT </dev/null'`. NetScaler does not ship `nc`/netcat or GNU `timeout`. The CLI may append `ERROR: Export failed` after shell commands; ignore that when telnet output shows `Connected to` or `Connection refused`.

Example — classic LB virtual server with service group:

```text
add lb vserver webserver_02 HTTP 192.168.20.227 80
add serviceGroup webserver_02_sg HTTP
bind serviceGroup webserver_02_sg 192.168.20.36 5173
bind lb vserver webserver_02 -serviceGroupName webserver_02_sg
save ns config
```

JPilot runs these via **`netscaler_run_cli_commands`** in one tool call after CLI reference lookup (often after the user submits a guided form).

### In-chat configuration forms

JPilot may reply with a short intro and a fenced `jpilot-form` JSON block. The UI renders fields (text, number, select, boolean, textarea). On submit, values are sent back as `Configuration inputs for: …` and the agent executes CLI with those values.

The backend also attaches a default classic LB form when the user clearly asks to **create** a load balancer / lb vserver and the model omitted the form — but **not** for responder, rewrite, transform, redirect, or bind/apply-to-existing-vserver requests.

## MCP tools

Enable or disable tools under **Settings → MCP Server**. **SSH fallback must be enabled** for diagnostic and SSL shell tools.

## Vendor brain layout

Each supported platform is defined under `backend-api/app/resources/vendors/<vendor>/manifest.json` and points at:

- `memory/<vendor>/` — RAG markdown (e.g. `cisco_ios_switch_memory.md`)
- `prompts/<vendor>/roles/` — live system prompts (`operator.md`, `analyst.md`, …)
- `architect/<vendor>/` — planning templates (NetScaler today)
- MCP tool names + connect mode (`nextgen` vs `ssh`) in the manifest

Registry: `backend-api/app/services/vendor_registry.py` loads manifests and drives tool filtering, prompt paths, and appliance eligibility.

**Supported today:** `netscaler`, `cisco` (IOS/XE switches via SSH).

## Memory files

Official-syntax references for JPilot RAG live under `backend-api/app/resources/memory/<vendor>/`:

- `memory/netscaler/netscaler_nextgen_api_memory.md` — Next-Gen API endpoints, payloads, behavioral rules
- `memory/netscaler/netscaler_adc_cli_memory.md` — ADC CLI namespaces, commands, behavioral rules
- `memory/f5/`, `memory/cisco/` — placeholders for future vendor memory packs

Architect planning references: `backend-api/app/resources/architect/<vendor>/` (NetScaler: design outline, Citrix integration refs).

## Prompts (vendor + role)

Live chat system prompts load from `backend-api/app/resources/prompts/<vendor>/`:

- `prompts/netscaler/roles/architect.md`, `operator.md`, `analyst.md` — sent to the LLM based on chat role and connected appliance vendor
- `prompts/netscaler/roles/shared_doc_rules.md`, `architect_discovery.md` — shared fragments included via `{{include:…}}`
- `prompts/netscaler/netscaler-copilot-prompt.md` — original project build spec (reference only, not loaded at chat runtime)
- `prompts/f5/`, `prompts/cisco/` — placeholders for future vendor prompt packs

Selection logic: `resolve_chat_vendor()` + `prompt_loader.load_role_prompt()` (see `prompt_paths.py`, `copilot_vendors.py`).

Add more `.md` files under the vendor memory folder; register filenames in `copilot_vendors.py` and wire a memory service. In production, `resources/` is bind-mounted so you can update memory and prompts without rebuilding the image.

JPilot search tools read memory before executing NetScaler write operations. Blocked tool responses include `requiredAction` telling the model to search first.

## Development

Set `NSAGENT_DEPLOY_MODE=dev` in `.env` (or pick **Development** in the installer). Source is
bind-mounted into containers; **Uvicorn `--reload`** and **Vite HMR** pick up changes without rebuild.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# or: ./compose.sh up -d --build
# pull main, then pick dev or prod to rebuild:
./scripts/upgrade.sh
```

Health checks (dev stack exposes service ports via containers):

- Backend: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
- MCP: [http://localhost:8001/health](http://localhost:8001/health)
- MCP tools: [http://localhost:8001/tools](http://localhost:8001/tools)

After changing Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`, rebuild the affected image:

```bash
./compose.sh build backend-api mcp-server && ./compose.sh up -d backend-api mcp-server
```

## Production

Set `NSAGENT_DEPLOY_MODE=prod` in `.env` (the installer default). Production merges the base
stack with `docker-compose.prod.yml`: the frontend is compiled into the nginx image, and API
services run without reload or source bind mounts.

```bash
./scripts/prod-up.sh
# pull main and optionally rebuild stacks:
./scripts/upgrade.sh
# or with NSAGENT_DEPLOY_MODE=prod in .env:
./compose.sh up -d --build
# or explicitly:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Do **not** use `docker-compose.prod.yml` alone — it only contains production overrides. The base
`docker-compose.yml` defines MongoDB, networks, volumes, and shared service settings.

After changing the domain or `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, rebuild nginx so the UI picks up the new API URL:

```bash
./compose.sh up -d --build nginx
```

Use strong secrets, TLS in front of the UI/API, restrict MongoDB network access, configure SMTP
for password reset, and set `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`, `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`, and `CORS_ORIGINS` to your
real hostname.

### MongoDB crashes (production)

The stack pins **`mongo:8.2`** (not `latest`), uses **`restart: unless-stopped`** on all
services, and a **healthcheck** so `backend-api` and `mcp-server` start only after MongoDB
responds to `ping`.

**Why 8.2 and not 7.0?** Recent installs used `mongo:latest` (MongoDB **8.2.x**). Existing
data has feature compatibility version **8.2** — `mongo:7.0` or `mongo:8.0` exit with code
**62**. Pin **`mongo:8.2`** on existing servers; use **`mongo:7.0`** only for a **new** volume.

Before recreating, confirm the running image:

```bash
docker inspect nsagent-mongodb-1 --format '{{index .Config.Labels "org.opencontainers.image.version"}} {{.Config.Image}}'
```

**Check logs for corruption / abrupt shutdown:**

```bash
docker logs nsagent-mongodb-1 2>&1 | grep -i "fatal\|assert\|crash\|signal\|segfault\|abrupt\|unclean"
```

**Redeploy after pulling compose changes** (recreate Mongo so the pinned image applies):

```bash
./compose.sh up -d --force-recreate mongodb
./compose.sh up -d backend-api mcp-server nginx
```

**If MongoDB keeps exiting with code 139**, stop the stack and repair the data volume (volume
name is usually `<project>_nsagent_mongodb_data`, e.g. `nsagent_nsagent_mongodb_data`):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop mongodb
docker run --rm -v nsagent_nsagent_mongodb_data:/data/db mongo:8.2 mongod --repair
./compose.sh up -d mongodb
./compose.sh up -d backend-api mcp-server nginx
```
